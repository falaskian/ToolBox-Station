	<h1>Tools of the Trade</h1><p>Inside of your secure locker, you will find a <b>syringe gun</b> and some Morphine if things turn south. Your main tool of trade is <b>talk</b>, or \
	'psychotherapy' as a professional much like yourself would prefer to phrase it. Inside of your backpack you have two boxes: pharmacotherapy and psychopathology box. The first contains \
	lighter medication for those not-so-dire cases, whilst the other contains the serious stuff. Each pill bottle has its contets on the label, be sure to read it so as to not overdose your \
	patients. However, should that happen, you have two charcoal pill bottles in your secure locker. There are also some 'restraints' in there in case \
	your patients aren't being cooperative. Well, good luck!</p>"
